<p>  Hii so you wanna know a bit more about me. Working experience has been quite simple and diverse for me. 
  From the very initial stages of my life (say school life itself) ,I have been fortunate enough that management and social working is part of my life. <br>
</p> <p> <br>
Being part of various events, social services always attracted me.
It was my first interaction with an NGO that hit my heart, 
and I knew this was the field I want to go for, working independently and for the society. 
Having a tech background was a plus point for me.</p><p> <br>
Thereafter I worked on various projects like Dava(2015) ,
 this was the project for old aged citizens who face issues like not getting medicine due to lack of 
 availability and <small> misunderstanding</small>. 
</p><p> <br>
 Thereafter in 2017 another project for farmers. 
What usually happens is the farmer faces heavy losses due to the fraud of pricing and they
 are forced to sell their yield at lower price due to lack of knowledge about the ongoing market rates.
 So, Prixfit was a website that informed farmers about the current mandi rates, the response of which was quite positive. 
</p> <br>
<p> After these two projects also founded two NGO, that worked  for the service of stray animals and  now
   I am working for the visually impairds via my company Veeery (wanna more <a href="https://veeery.com/"> <u> click here</u> </a>).
</p><p> <br>
So up till now this is it. With all these experiences I wish to share my knowledge and experience with 
others and learn from them as well. 
So wanna learn something or you think you can teach me something, feel free to <a href="contact.html"><u> contact me</u></a>.
</p><p> <br>
 All I am gonna take is a bit of your time and a cup of coffee. Yes! it's free of cost so, go ahead 
 and hit <a href="contact.html"> <u> mail</u></a> for any reason.   
</p>
